# [Request Header Parser Microservice](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/apis-and-microservices/apis-and-microservices-projects/request-header-parser-microservice)

- This is my solution to the [Request Header Parser Microservice](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/apis-and-microservices/apis-and-microservices-projects/request-header-parser-microservice) challenge in the freeCodeCamp Back End Development Certification.
- The challenge is to parse the header of a request and return the value of the header passed in the request.
